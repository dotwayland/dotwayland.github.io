		<h1><a href="/2016/02/29/bash-port-scanning/">Port Scanning with Bash</a></h1>
	

	<div class="post-content"><p>Imagine that you are performing an assessment and you find yourself on a system that you need to pivot from and would like to perform some light reconnaissance on your next destination. The system you are using does not have netcat or nmap installed. What do you do? One possibility is that you can dial up <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/tcp</code> with a for loop to iterate through a port range using a transport protocol of your choosing.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">time for i in {0..1024}; do echo 'derp' &gt; /dev/tcp/deadbadger.nullkey.net/$i &amp;&amp; echo "$i is open"; done 2&gt;/dev/null</code></p>

<p>We start with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">time</code> command which will summarize system resource usage for the latter part of our one-liner. Next, we begin our <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop with the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> and use brace expansion to define our range of ports that we would like the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> to represent. Next, we need to tell Bash what to do for each iteration of the loop. In this example, we are telling it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo</code> the text “derp” to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/tcp</code> for the host deadbadger.nullkey.net. Immediately following you will notice that we have placed the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">$i</code> for the port numbers we told Bash we wanted it to iterate through earlier in the command. With chain re-direction of the text we are echoing to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/tcp</code> to another <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo</code> string with the text “<code class="highlighter-rouge">$i</code> is open” with the AND Operator (<code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;&amp;</code>) so that each time <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/tcp</code> receives a response from the host deadbadger.nullkey.net on current port iteration, it will print to STDOUT the text “22 is open”, for example. We tell the for loop to stop each iteration and begin the next one with <code class="highlighter-rouge">;</code> done and redirect STDERR to a file with <code class="highlighter-rouge">2&gt;/dev/null</code> (in this case we are simply discarding it by sending it to the null device).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>derp@zerocool:~# time for i in {0..1024}; do echo 'derp' &gt; /dev/tcp/deadbadger.nullkey.net/$i &amp;&amp; echo "$i is open"; done 2&gt;/dev/null
22 is open
111 is open

real    0m30.084s
user    0m0.220s
sys    0m0.416s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Per RFC 793, when using TCP as your transport for this type of reconnaissance, the scanning host will know that the target host is listening on a particular port if it receives a SYN-ACK response to the initial SYN communication on whatever port is being examined. The host being scanned will send a RST-ACK if it receives a SYN on a non-listening port.</p>

<p>This kind of port mapping can also be accomplished with UDP traffic by dialing up <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/udp</code> where the scanning host will deduce that a port is listening if it does not receive an ICMP port unreachable message from the target host. Mapping open UDP ports relies on the assumption that there is nothing filtering ICMP traffic in between the scanning and the target host. If ICMP traffic is being filtered, it may appear to the scanner that all ports are open (remember UDP as a transport provides no confirmation of delivery so IP error detection is all we have unless something at the application layer responds as is the case with DNS).</p>

<p>You do not need to be root to perform this type of scanning since normal users can create sockets and establish full connections to any port.</p>
