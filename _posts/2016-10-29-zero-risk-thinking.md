My team recently had the joy of responding to yet another phishing attack. This time with an interesting “Hey, I’m a researcher too. Let’s collaborate!” pretext. Needless to say, it was effective. Also needless to say, our response was effective. We leveraged our logging prowess and a whole bunch of automation to squash the attack in not a lot of time.

When responding to leaked credentials, we’ll take a concierge-like approach (time permitting) and call people to notify them of the issue. Responses range anywhere from frustration “Argh, I’m usually savvy about this stuff!” to denial “No, I don’t believe you”. The gist is that emotions run the gamut when a person finds out they have been deceived. A question I often get is “What can I do to prevent this from happening again?” There are always the standard answers, such as “We’ll never ask you for your password, so if someone does, it’s probably not legit” to “Make sure the URL of the site you are on is affiliated with us”, etc. That’s all good stuff.

I wanted to point out a particularly stupid piece of advice that I heard discussed this week. No, it wasn’t from anyone on my team.

“Don’t click on any links in e-mail ever”. Not from me, not from your parents, not from your collaborators. It’s better to be non-responsive and have someone send you a few follow up e-mails than fall victim to a phishing attack. Wait, what? Are you going to uninstall my web browser too?

Don’t get me wrong this approach works. If you never click on links or open attachments in e-mails, you’d never get phished. As a matter of fact, your computer would never get malware if you just never used it. While we’re at it, we could virtually eliminate the risk of car accidents if we never drove anywhere.

My point is that zero-risk thinking is harmful. It’s harmful to organizations and to individuals. I work at an R1 where some of the worlds greatest advancements in Engineering and Agriculture have taken place. The truth is that you cannot innovate in this manner without embracing risk. Sure there are plenty that you’d never take; it’s also true that some, if not taken, will forego certain rewards.

This also means that prevention as a security model is somewhat flawed. Do you want to know how to secure your organization? Unplug your computers. You’re done. But, wait? What happens to your competitive advantage, your research innovation? I promise that the inability to submit grant proposals or collaborate with others in a meaningful way are greater organizational risks than a handful of compromised accounts.  That handful, by the way, can be detected and responded to.

Technology risk is a small, small part of organizational risk. When looking at the two, train yourself to consider the rewards associated with taking those risks.
