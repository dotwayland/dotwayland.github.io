My team recently responded to yet another phishing campaign. This time with an interesting “Hey, I’m a researcher too. Let’s collaborate!” pretext. Needless to say, it was effective but so was our response. We leveraged our logging prowess and a whole bunch of automation to mitigate the attack in not a lot of time.

When responding to leaked credentials, we’ll take a concierge-like approach and call people to notify them of the issue. Responses range anywhere from frustration “Argh, I’m usually savvy about this stuff!” to denial “No, I don’t believe you”. The gist is that emotions run the gamut when a person finds out they have been deceived. A question I often get is “What can I do to prevent this from happening again?” There are always the standard answers, such as “We’ll never ask you for your password, so if someone does, it’s probably not legit” to “Make sure the URL of the site you are on is affiliated with us”, etc. That’s all good stuff.

I wanted to point out a particularly stupid piece of advice that I heard discussed this week. No, it wasn’t from anyone on my team.

“Don’t click on any links in e-mail ever. Not from me, not from your parents, not from your collaborators. It’s better to be non-responsive and have someone send you a few follow up e-mails than fall victim to a phishing attack." Wait, what? Should I uninstall my web browser too?

Hyperbole aside, this approach works. If you never clicked on links or opened attachments, you’d never get phished. As a matter of fact, your computer would never get malware if you just never used it. While we’re at it, we could virtually eliminate the risk of car accidents if we never drove anywhere. Aren't some risks worth taking? Yes!

Zero-risk thinking is harmful. It’s harmful to organizations and to individuals. I work at an R1 where some of the worlds greatest advancements in Engineering and Agriculture have taken place. The truth is that you cannot innovate in this manner without embracing risk. Sure there are plenty of risks that you’d never take; it’s also true that some, if not taken, will forego certain rewards.

This also suggests that prevention as a security model is somewhat flawed. To prevent all threats, you would need to eliminate all risk. How can we do that while still seizing new opportunities? Do you want to know how to secure your organization? Unplug your computers. You’re done. But, wait? What happens to your competitive advantage, your research innovation? I promise that the inability to submit grant proposals or collaborate with others in a meaningful way are greater organizational risks than the possibility of account compromises. This isn't to say we accept assets being compromised, but everything must exist in balance.  

Technology risk is a small, small part of organizational risk. When looking at the two, train yourself to consider the rewards associated with taking those risks. Prevention and response are two sides of the same token that is data security.
