**Abstract:**

In this [paper][paper] the authors present ISLET; the Isolated, Scalable, & Lightweight Environment for Training. ISLET overcomes many of the distribution, scaling and security challenges of providing mass training to students requiring an interactive GNU/Linux commandline environment. This Docker-based solution is evaluated and lessons learned from real world experience with ISLET are discussed.
